* At the base of what we learn in the web tools’ course, I want to implement the library system(books management system).
* There are two main characters to interact with system. 
### The first one is MANAGER role, who can take the role of add new books and update books’ information. The manager’s information is set by the systems and cannot be changed by any users. There are three functions for manager to achieve. 
* Achieve multiple operations on the book. 1)Add new book to the systems. 2)Change book’ basic information in the systems. 3)Delete the book from the system.
* Change the students’ book return status. When the student returns the book, the manager can set the change the students’ book borrowing status.
* View all the comments and delete useless comments.

 
### The second one is STUDENT role, who only can borrow books from the systems. 
*	The student can register by themselves and then login to the systems. 
* After they login the system, student’s role can search books by different attributes and borrow it. The student cannot set the return states of the books.
* View the catalog of borrowed books and comment them.
